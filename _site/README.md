<<<<<<< HEAD
Here you will find examples of simple quantitative macroeconomic models formulated mostly in python. It intends to be a
resource for my own teaching thus it will evently point to a graduate macro course. Such course does not exists yet, but 
let me suggest to you the excelent site created by Tom Sargent and John Stachurski: Quantitative Economics http://quant-econ.net/
and start working on the tutorials and examples they provide. I'm sure to ask my students to do so!
