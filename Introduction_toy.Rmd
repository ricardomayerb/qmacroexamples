Introducing a basic ('toy') model
========================================================

This is the basic RBC model with endogenous labor and logarithmic preferences, with two small additions regardig the productivity process. The name basic comes from de fact that many common modifications are absent: variable capital utilizacion, non-TFP (or non-labor) shocks, adjustment costs, imperfect information, multiple economic sectors, borrow constraints and imperfect information to name a few. The only non-basic feature is that the economy is non-stationary and there are permanent and transitory shocks not to the level of productivity but to its growth rate. We have started with this bare bones model
